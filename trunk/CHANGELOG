	* Version 0.1 Final.
	==========================

	* Updated to zlib v1.2.3 (that resolves some security issues).

	* Updated to libpng v1.2.8 (that resolves some security issues).

	* Added Visual Studio .Net 2003 build solution (it includes kernel library and examples).

	* Added installer and binaries for Windows platform.

	* Expanded string conversion of number, vectors and quaternions. Now functions accept a standard printf-like
	formatting string (ex: "%5.2f") as parameter.

	* Fixed a bug in the kernel class, that caused some memory leaks and crashes in the automatic memory retrivial (garbage collector).

	* Added full support for paletted images, and implemented an octree color quantization.

	* Changed GMesh2D class, now it's a template.

	* More robust predicates have been introduced into tesselator (dictionary order, segments intersection, CCW smaller angle span).

	* Fixed some minor and major bugs of tesselator. In particular some right diagonal cases made region collector crash, and in some degenerative
	situations (deep otimization under gcc on Mac) an infinitive loop may be occurred.

	* Added filling rules for tesselation (ODD, EVEN, BOTH).

	* Added indexed array output in the tesselator api. So now, plain vertex and indexed output are available.

	* Added a new example, called tesselator2d; it shows the realtime capabilities of Amanith tesselator.

	* Fixed optimized cubic Bézier flattening when compiled using float real type.

	* Added official support of Qt4 for examples and tools. So now the entire framework can be compiled with it. Please look at settings.conf file.

	* Added unofficial support for MinGW compiler. It seems that MinGW has a bug that make not possible to export from dynamic libraries instantied
	template classes. So in the Amanith case, the instantied template classes GMesh2D<GFloat> and GMesh2D<GDouble> could not be seen from the
	delaunay2d example. We wish that this bug will be resolved into next MinGW version. Anyway the entire framework, examples and tools can be
	compiled except for delaunay2d example. Please look at settings.conf file.
