AMANITH FRAMEWORK INSTALLATION GUIDE

===============================================================================================================================================

1.Extract all files into a directory (Es: tar -xzf amanith.tar.gz).

2.Export the environment variable AMANITHDIR in according with the directory where you have extracted all files (Es: /home/frank/amanith)
  Add $AMANITHDIR/lib path to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

    2a.For bash/ksh/zsh/sh shells this can be easily done editing the file ~/.profile (See below)

        ...
        QTDIR=/usr/local/qt
        MANPATH=$QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
        PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
        AMANITHDIR=/home/frank/amanith
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$AMANITHDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export AMANITHDIR QTDIR PATH MANPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ...

    2b.For csh/tcsh shells edit the file ~/.login (See below)
    
        ...
        setenv QTDIR /usr/local/qt
        setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
        setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
        setenv AMANITHDIR /home/frank/amanith
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$AMANITHDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ...

 After you have done this, you will need to login again, or re-source the profile before continuing, so that at least $AMANITHDIR is set.
 
 Note that under IRIX the additional LD_LIBRARYN32_PATH and LD_LIBRARY64_PATH variables are used for specifying library search paths.
 Set the variable that matches your configuration, or see the rld(5) man page for more information.

 On AIX set LIBPATH and on HP-UX set SHLIB_PATH instead of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
 After these settings reboot the system and you have done.

3.Now you are ready to compile the entire framework.
  Note that QMAKE is needed to build AMANITH CORE and QT is needed to build all EXAMPLES and TOOLS.
  First check the file $AMANITHDIR/config/settings.conf, this file contains the settings that you can change to match your preferences.
  When done follow those steps :
  
    CD $AMANITHDIR
    QMAKE amanith.pro
    MAKE

4.If all operations have been a successful ending, you can found compiled libs into $AMANITHDIR/lib, plugins in $AMANITHDIR/plugins and
  tools in $AMANITHDIR/tools.
  You can start looking some examples in $AMANITHDIR/examples directory or just visit http://www.amanith.org to get tutorials, documentation
  and support.

5.Don't forget to read LICENSE.QPL to understand the license terms.

1.Extract all files into a directory (Es: tar -xzf amanith.tar.gz).

2.Export the environment variable AMANITHDIR in according with the directory where you have extracted all files (Es: /Users/frank/amanith)
  Add $AMANITHDIR/lib path to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.

    2a.For bash shell this can be easily done editing the file ~/.profile (See below)

        ...
        QTDIR=/Developer/qt
        PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH
        AMANITHDIR=/Users/frank/amanith
        DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QTDIR/lib:$AMANITHDIR/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export AMANITHDIR QTDIR PATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ...

    2b.For csh/tcsh shells edit the file ~/.login (See below)

        ...
        setenv QTDIR /Developer/qt
        setenv MANPATH $QTDIR/doc/man:$MANPATH
        setenv PATH $QTDIR/bin:$PATH
        setenv AMANITHDIR /Users/frank/amanith
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $QTDIR/lib:$AMANITHDIR/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        ...

3.Set the environment variables for the Finder, so all programs that use Amanith can be executed without problems through Finder.
  Apple provides a mechanism for this via a special file, ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist (Careful, it's case sensitive, of course). This XML file
  can be created with the Property List editor, or your favorite text editor. Here's a sample:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>QTDIR</key>
            <string>/Developer/qt</string>
            <key>AMANITHDIR</key>
            <string>/Users/frank/amanith</string>
            <key>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</key>
            <string>/usr/local/lib:/Developer/qt/lib:/Users/frank/amanith</string>
        </dict>
    </plist>

  After these settings reboot the system and you have done.

4.Now you are ready to compile the entire framework.
  Note that QMAKE is needed to build AMANITH CORE and QT is needed to build all EXAMPLES and TOOLS.
  First check the file $AMANITHDIR/config/settings.conf, this file contains the settings that you can change to match your preferences.
  When done follow those steps :
  
    CD $AMANITHDIR
    QMAKE amanith.pro
    MAKE

5.If all operations have been a successful ending, you can found compiled libs into $AMANITHDIR/lib, plugins in $AMANITHDIR/plugins and
  tools in $AMANITHDIR/tools.

1.Extract all files into a directory (Es: C:\Amanith).

2.Export the environment variable AMANITHDIR in according with the directory where you have extracted all files, this can be easily done with
  regedit.exe following those steps :

    search key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment
    add new Expandible String (REG_EXPAND_SZ)
    rename this to "AMANITHDIR"
    set the value to "C:\Amanith"

  now add AMANITHDIR\lib to the PATH

    add the value "C:\Amanith\lib" to "PATH"

  After this, the key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment can be look like this:

    ...
    "LIB"="C:\Programs\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\SDK\v1.1\Lib\"
    "INCLUDE"="C:\Programs\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\SDK\v1.1\include\"
    "PATH"="C:\Qt\3.3.1\bin;C:\Amanith\lib"
    "QTDIR"="C:\Qt\3.3.1"
    "QMAKESPEC"="win32-msvc.net"
    "AMANITHDIR"="C:\Amanith"
    ...

3.Now you are ready to compile the entire framework.
  Note that QMAKE is needed to build AMANITH CORE and QT is needed to build all EXAMPLES and TOOLS.
  First check the file %AMANITHDIR%/config/settings.conf, this file contains the settings that you can change to match your preferences.
  When done follow those steps :
  
    CD %AMANITHDIR%
    QMAKE amanith.pro
    NMAKE

4.If all operations have been a successful ending, you can found compiled libs into %AMANITHDIR%/lib, plugins in %AMANITHDIR%/plugins and
  tools in %AMANITHDIR%/tools.
  You can start looking some examples in %AMANITHDIR%/examples directory or just visit http://www.amanith.org to get tutorials, documentation
  and support.
